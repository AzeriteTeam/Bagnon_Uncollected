This is a simple plugin for the addon [Bagnon](https://mods.curse.com/addons/wow/bagnon) that shows a purple eye on equippable gear in your bags which appearance you haven't yet collected. 

If you're looking for something that displays both the purple uncollected eye, item level, BoE status and tones down garbage all at once, we recommend our all-in-one plugin [Bagnon ItemInfo](https://mods.curse.com/addons/wow/bagnon-iteminfo) to avoid having more button updates than needed.
